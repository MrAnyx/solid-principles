# Open-Closed Principle

In order to make a class easy to reuse across several projects, it may be important to apply this principle. This
principle indicates that a class should, as much as possible, be open to evolution and closed to modification.

In other words, this principle makes it possible to extend the behavior of a class without making changes to it.

On the other hand, if we had to make changes for each new feature, it would be almost impossible to maintain a
functional code.

Thus, the main advantages of this principle are:

- To facilitate the evolution of a class,
- Make the code more flexible in general.
