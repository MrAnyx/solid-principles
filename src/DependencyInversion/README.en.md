# Dependency Inversion Principle

The principle of dependency inversion is a principle that says that the use of interfaces or more global classes should
be preferred to child classes that are too precise and with a too low level of abstraction.

Finally, this principle is closely linked to the Liskov substitution that we detailed previously.

This principle thus allows to:

- Make the code more flexible,
- Facilitate the evolution of the project.
